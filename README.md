# partymix-frontend


PartyMix is a party or event template creator for mixing and matching all the different types of things you can arrange for your special day/night. Users can get ideas from serveral provided templates or they can create their own unique assortments, adding as many items from across nine different party item categories that they please.

## Installation

After cloning or downloading the project backend repo, use the bash terminal to install the gems by typing:

bundle install

After gems are installed, seed some objects for example content by typing:

rails db:seed

After seeding, start the server by typing:

rails s

Clone and download the project frontend repo, then launch in the browser by entering:

open index.html

## Usage

The PartyMix app includes frontend and backend repositories powered by javascript/html/css and ruby on rails framework, respectively. Users may add or delete existing parties from the database and may customize their created parties with different categories dynamically in real time.

## Development
After checking out the repo, run bundle install to install dependencies. You can run rails console for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

Run rails s to start the server or Control + C to stop the server.
